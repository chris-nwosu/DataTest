  *Importing Data*
- The video starts by importing data from an external Excel workbook into Power Query [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkGHODb3zgQ&t=259s&t=107)].

- This involves connecting Power Query to the source of the data, which in this case is an Excel file. Power Query can connect to many different data sources, including databases, text files, and web pages.
- Instead of selecting specific sheets, the folder icon is selected to access all data [04:50].

This suggests the Excel file contains multiple sheets with similar data structures that need to be combined. Importing at the folder level allows Power Query to process all the files/sheets at once.
The video then reviews the content of the Excel workbook [04:33].
This step is crucial for understanding the structure of the data, identifying any inconsistencies, and planning the subsequent transformation steps. It involves looking at the columns, data types, and sample values.
